<h1 style="text-align:center;">CNIT-132 Homework 1</h1> <!-- inserting the double quotes (") symbols inside the 'h1 opening tag', by the CSS proverty-value and add a semicolon (;) at the end of CSS value and I also changed the "h1 end tag" to a lowercase as it is recomended by W3C although HTML is NOT a case sensitive -->
<p>In this homework we will be changing this code to be a valid code in HTML5.</p> <!-- I added <p> closing tag, because it's a good practice, well-formed html writing -->
<p>We will probably need to change a lot of details around the code and the basic idea of this Homework is to learn how to use the validator from W3C.</p>
<p><img style="float:left;" SRC="oldboat.gif" alt="oldboat">The image you see here will be used a lot in many exercises we will be doing in class! This is an old boat, probably an old ship. One of those types used to transport heavy cargo in the old times?!?! Of course this picture is not real, but you can imagine a big boat made basically of wood and using the main power of the wind! Remember that this picture needs to be uploaded to the Hills Server (your account) together with this file you are modifying, otherwise, the picture will not be shown!</p> <!-- I added </p> closing tag, because it's a good practice, well-formed of writing html -->
<p>You will be able to change a little bit the content of the two paragraphs below to insert the links requested to make sense when reading the content.</p> <!-- I added <p> closing tag, because it's a good practice, well-formed of writing html -->
<p><a href="http://www.ccsf.edu/" target="_blank">The link to be inserted here should open in a new window or tab.</a></p> <!-- I put the <a> tag in between the <p> tag and I put target property with value "_blank" for the link to open in a new window -->
<p><a href="http://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml/#Origins" target="_blank">This second link will take you to a web page to a target reference name within that page. This link should also open in a new window or tab.</a></p> <!-- I put the <a> tag in between the <p> tag and I put target property with value "_blank" for the link to open in a new window and the target reference link will open on the paragraph "Origins to the internet" by adding "#Origins" at the end of the URL adress -->
<p>Include here below a horizontal ruler to divide the page</p>
<hr> <!-- I insert the <hr> -->
<h2>Subtitle of our page</h2> <!-- I changed the h2 tag to a lowercase as it is recomended by W3C although HTML is NOT a case sensitive  -->
<p>It's funny to see this page being upgraded<br>
We will be dealing with a lot of details in this code <!-- I erased <br> tag on this 2nd line, because I want to link the 2nd and 3rd line in one sentence. -->
and that's the idea of this exercise!</p>
<section>
	<h3>At least I am using one new HTML5 tag - the section tag.</h3>
	<p>Not sure if I am using it correctly!</p>
</section>
<p>I am trying to build an unordered list here below. Would you be able to help me?</p>
<ul>
	<li>planning a web page</li>
	<li>studying the target audience</li>
	<li>following standards when coding</li>
</ul> <!-- I put <ul> opening and closing tags outside the <li> tags, and I also put the </li> at the end of every <li>, and I erased the "-" next to the first <li>. -->
<p>Make sure you upload your file to Hills, inside the public_html folder, make sure also to upload the image of the oldboat but, especially for his work, make sure you validate your code!</p> <!-- I added <p> closing tag, because it's a good practice, well-formed of writing html -->

</body>
</html> <!-- I changed the <html> tag into a lowercase. -->
